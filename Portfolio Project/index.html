    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <article>
      <p class="about">Hello! My name is Shanice and I am a project manager looking to switch careers into tech.</p>
      <p class="about">My background is mostly in sport - I studied sport and exercise science at Sheffield Hallam university, followed by a master's degree in sports law. I had various jobs coming out of university, but I landed by dream job at UK Anti-Doping where I worked within the testing team. I worked at UKAD for around 3 years, before switching careers into equality, diversity and inclusion. During 2020 when the murder of George Floyd happened, I wanted to learn more about EDI and how to make a workplace environment inclusive and psychologically safe for all.</p>
      <p class="about">In 2022, I landed the role of EDI Officer (Projects) at the Institute of Physics where I am currently managing a project that aims to help university physics departments create an inclusive environment and encourage people from different backgrounds to study physics. This was a huge career switch from sport which I had been involved in for so many years, but I believed it was the right step to develop my skills further in managing a large-scale project for the first time.</p>
      <p class="about">In January 2023, I started learning coding through organisations such as Code First Girls, Codeacademy and the Code Institute. After learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, I have created a number of projects to practice and better my skills. Creating websites and apps have unlocked a creative side that I didn't know I had! I am now working on building my portfolio, creating different projects and challenging myself.</p>
        <h3 id="fun-facts">5 Fun Facts!</h3>
        <ol class="facts">
          <li>I am of Jamaican and English/Irish heritage.</li>
          <li>I played tennis from the ages of 7 - 25 years and played at an u14s tournament at Wimbledon.</li>
          <li>I also worked at Wimbledon as a court attendant (we were the fast people that covered the courts when it was raining!)</li>
          <li>I love to cook, especially Caribbean food.</li>
          <li>I am a gamer and love to escape from reality with my PS5...</li>

        <p class>The first web page I built was for the Code First Girls Web Development course which ran for 8 weeks. The course was an introduction to web development where I learned the fundamental skills of front-end development, including Bootstrap and UX/UI design. I learned how to build a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, UX/UI design and GitHub. The requirements for the project are listed below.</p>
        <p>Sharks are one of my favourite animals, so I decided to base my website around different types of sharks, with fun facts and information about how climate change is affecting species of sharks. A link to the website can be found in the table below.</p>
      </article>
      <h4>'Must have' requirements:</h4>
      <ul class="web">
        <li>A minimum of 2 HTML web pages and one external CSS file.</li>
        <li>A website wireframe.</li>
        <li>Use a CSS framework.</li>
        <li>All links working.</li>
        <li>Basic user interaction (e.g., hover, submit form, action on click).</li>
        <li>Adhering to UI/UX rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>'Nice to have' requirements:</h4>
      <ul class="web">
        <li>Mobile responsive website.</li>
        <li>Effective use of classes and IDs.</li>
        <li>JavaScript used to enable user interaction.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>The next project I created within the Code First Girls JavaScript class was a Harry Potter shopping app. Within the 8 week JavaScript course, I boosted my coding skills by using JavaScript to create an interactive web app which included learning about the DOM and debugging. The requirements for the final project can be found in the list below.</p>
        <p>I am  HUGE Harry Potter fan and I decided to do a shopping app as one of the classes covered this which I really enjoyed. The web app is for Hogwarts witches and wizards and they would input all the items they need to get from Diagon Alley. Items could include an owl, wand and books! A link to the CodePen can be found in the table below.</p>
      </article>
      <h4>'Must have' requirements:</h4>
      <ul class="web">
        <li>Get input from the user on a web page.</li>
        <li>Make changes to the HTML and/or CSS using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Use an event to trigger a change to a web page.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>'Nice to have' requirements:</h4>
      <ul class="web">
        <li>Add HTML elements to a web page using the DOM.</li>
        <li>Remove HTML elements from a web page using the DOM.</li>
        <li>Research and use other DOM events such as <strong>onmouseover.</strong></li>
        <li>USe arrays, loops and/or conditional logic in JavaScript.</li>

      <article class="web">
        <p>This blog page is something I have been working on solo, using everything that I have learned so far through Codeacademy, Code First Girls and other providers. It is still a working progress, but a link to the blog can be found in the table below.</p>
        <p>I decided to create a blog page based on my family holiday to Jamaica as it was our first time travelling there. It was a very special moment for us as my grandparents were born in Jamaica and travelled to England during the Windrush generation. Growing up, I have always felt proud of my roots and I always wanted to go to Jamaica, to get a taste of what it as like for my grandparents growing up. It may have taken us a long time to book the damn holiday, but we did it! The blog page will talk about my family history, what we did in Jamaica and some travel tips for those who are also thinking of visiting.</p>
