    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <article>
      <p class="about">Hello! My name is Shanice and I am a project manager looking to switch careers into tech.</p>
      <p class="about">My background is mostly in sport - I studies sport and exercise science at Sheffield Hallam university, followed by a master's degree in sports law. I had various jobs coming out of university, but I landed by dream job at UK Anti-Doping where I worked within the testing team. I worked at UKAD for around 3 years, before switching careers into equality, diversity and inclusion. During 2020 when the murder of George Floyd happened, I wanted to learn more about EDI and how to make a workplace envrionment inclusive and psychologically safe for all.</p>
      <p class="about">In 2022, I landed the role of EDI Officer at the Institute of Physics where I am currently managing a project that aims to help university physics departments create an inclusive environment and encourage people from different backgrounds to study physics. This was a huge career switch out of sport which I had been involved in for so many years, but I believed it was the right step to develop my skills further and to manage a project for the first time.</p>
      <p class="about">In January 2023, I started learning coding through organisations such as Code First Girls, Codeacademy and the Code Institute. After learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, I have created a number of projects to practice and better my skills. Creating websites and apps have unlocked a creative side that I didn't know I had! I am now working on building my portfolio, creating different projects and challenging myself.</p>
